const questions = [
  {
    question: "In zero-shot learning, the model predicts without any training on the specific task. What is the key advantage of zero-shot learning?",
    choice1: "A) It requires a large labeled dataset.",
    choice2: "B) It can be used for tasks not seen during training.",
    choice3: "C) It has a higher accuracy than few-shot learning.",
    choice4: "D) It uses a smaller input size.",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Zero-shot learning allows a model to make predictions on tasks it has never seen during training, by leveraging prior knowledge and context."
  },
  {
    question: "In few-shot learning, how does the model improve its performance for a specific task?",
    choice1: "A) By training with a large dataset.",
    choice2: "B) By using a predefined model with no task-specific data.",
    choice3: "C) By using a few examples to adjust the model's behavior.",
    choice4: "D) By ignoring all prior knowledge.",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Few-shot learning involves training a model with a small number of examples, which helps the model adjust to a new task with limited data."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a common challenge in few-shot learning?",
    choice1: "A) Insufficient labeled data for training.",
    choice2: "B) Overfitting to small datasets.",
    choice3: "C) Inability to adapt to new tasks.",
    choice4: "D) High computational cost for large datasets.",
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Few-shot learning struggles with the limited amount of labeled data, which can make it difficult for the model to generalize well."
  },
  {
    question: "Which technique is primarily used to improve the accuracy of zero-shot learning models?",
    choice1: "A) Data augmentation.",
    choice2: "B) Transfer learning from similar tasks.",
    choice3: "C) Active learning.",
    choice4: "D) Reinforcement learning.",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Transfer learning, which leverages a model pre-trained on similar tasks, is commonly used to enhance the performance of zero-shot models."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the main disadvantage of zero-shot learning?",
    choice1: "A) Requires a large amount of training data.",
    choice2: "B) It may not generalize well to new tasks.",
    choice3: "C) The model needs fine-tuning for each task.",
    choice4: "D) The model requires task-specific data.",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Since zero-shot learning relies on a model's ability to generalize from prior knowledge, it may not always perform well on tasks that differ significantly from those seen during training."
  },
  {
    question: "In few-shot learning, how are the examples typically presented to the model?",
    choice1: "A) As raw images only.",
    choice2: "B) As a small number of labeled samples for the task.",
    choice3: "C) As pre-trained weights for similar tasks.",
    choice4: "D) As unsupervised data points.",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Few-shot learning involves providing a small number of labeled examples, which the model uses to adapt its behavior to the task."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an advantage of few-shot learning over zero-shot learning?",
    choice1: "A) It can make better predictions with minimal task-specific data.",
    choice2: "B) It requires no task-specific data.",
    choice3: "C) It can achieve higher accuracy on specific tasks.",
    choice4: "D) It requires more computational resources.",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Few-shot learning typically achieves higher accuracy on specific tasks by fine-tuning the model with a small set of examples, compared to zero-shot learning."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the performance of a zero-shot model compare to a few-shot model when there is a lack of training data?",
    choice1: "A) Zero-shot models perform better.",
    choice2: "B) Few-shot models perform better.",
    choice3: "C) Both perform equally well.",
    choice4: "D) Both fail to perform well.",
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Zero-shot models perform better in situations with no task-specific training data because they rely on prior general knowledge, while few-shot models need a small set of examples."
  },
  {
    question: "Which model typically needs more computational resources during training, few-shot or zero-shot learning?",
    choice1: "A) Zero-shot learning.",
    choice2: "B) Few-shot learning.",
    choice3: "C) Both use equal resources.",
    choice4: "D) Neither require computational resources.",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Few-shot learning often requires more computational resources because it involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a small set of examples for the task."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is the primary use case for zero-shot learning?",
    choice1: "A) Tasks with limited data but abundant labeled examples.",
    choice2: "B) Tasks with little to no task-specific data.",
    choice3: "C) Tasks with a lot of labeled data.",
    choice4: "D) Tasks that are too complex to learn from any data.",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Zero-shot learning is most useful in scenarios where there is little or no labeled data available for the task at hand, but general knowledge can be transferred."
