        question: "A train 120 meters long takes 6 seconds to cross a man running at 10 km/hr in the same direction. Find the speed of the train.",
        options: ["60 km/hr", "72 km/hr", "80 km/hr", "90 km/hr"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Relative speed = speed of train - speed of man = x - 10. Speed = Distance / Time => x - 10 = (120/6) * (18/5) => x = 72 km/hr."
      },
      {
        question: "A train 100 meters long is running at the speed of 36 km/hr. In what time will it pass a man who is running at 6 km/hr in the opposite direction?",
