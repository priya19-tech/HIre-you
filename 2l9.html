const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the main goal of bagging in ensemble learning?",
    options: [
      "A) Reduce bias",
      "B) Reduce variance",
      "C) Improve interpretability",
      "D) Increase bias"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) helps reduce variance by averaging multiple models trained on different bootstrapped samples."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an example of a bagging technique?",
    options: [
      "A) AdaBoost",
      "B) Gradient Boosting",
      "C) Random Forest",
      "D) XGBoost"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Random Forest is a classic example of bagging where multiple decision trees are built on random subsets of the data."
  },
  {
    question: "How does boosting improve model performance?",
    options: [
      "A) By training on different features",
      "B) By sequentially focusing on errors made by previous models",
      "C) By averaging predictions of all models",
      "D) By selecting the best single model"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Boosting builds models sequentially, giving more weight to data points that were misclassified in earlier iterations."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is not true about bagging?",
    options: [
      "A) Models are trained independently",
      "B) Boosting is a form of bagging",
      "C) Bagging helps reduce overfitting",
      "D) It uses bootstrapped datasets"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Boosting and bagging are different approaches‚Äîboosting is sequential while bagging is parallel."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is true about boosting techniques like AdaBoost and XGBoost?",
    options: [
      "A) They focus on minimizing the errors of previous learners",
      "B) They randomly sample features at each node",
      "C) They only use one weak learner",
      "D) They increase variance"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Boosting adjusts the weights of data points to focus on those that previous learners got wrong."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a key feature of Random Forest?",
    options: [
      "A) Single decision tree",
      "B) Multiple trees built on different data & feature subsets",
      "C) Weights on instances",
      "D) Sequential training"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Random Forest builds many trees using random samples of the data and random subsets of features, which helps reduce overfitting."
  },
  {
    question: "Which ensemble method is more prone to overfitting if not tuned properly?",
    options: [
      "A) Bagging",
      "B) Boosting",
      "C) PCA",
      "D) Logistic Regression"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Boosting can overfit the training data, especially with complex learners and too many iterations."
  },
  {
    question: "What does XGBoost stand for?",
    options: [
      "A) Extreme Graphical Boost",
      "B) Extreme Gradient Boosting",
      "C) Extra Gaussian Boosting",
      "D) Extended Gradient Bias"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, a high-performance boosting method optimized for speed and accuracy."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of these techniques typically uses decision trees as base learners?",
    options: [
      "A) Naive Bayes",
      "B) Random Forest and AdaBoost",
      "C) SVM",
      "D) KNN"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Both Random Forest (bagging) and AdaBoost (boosting) commonly use decision trees as weak learners."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is Random Forest less likely to overfit than a single decision tree?",
    options: [
      "A) It uses linear regression",
      "B) It uses boosting",
      "C) It averages multiple de-correlated trees to reduce variance",
      "D) It increases bias"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Random Forest averages predictions from multiple trees, reducing the likelihood of overfitting and lowering variance."
