const questions = [
  {
    question: "In deep learning, the vanishing gradient problem occurs when:",
    choice1: "A) The gradient becomes too large, causing overflow",
    choice2: "B) The gradient becomes small and ineffective for weight updates during backpropagation",
    choice3: "C) The gradient becomes small and ineffective for weight updates during backpropagation",
    choice4: "D) The gradient does not change with the number of epochs",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "The vanishing gradient problem happens when gradients become too small to effectively update weights, especially in deep neural networks."
  },
  {
    question: "In the context of stochastic processes, which of the following is a property of a Poisson process?",
    choice1: "A) It is continuous and has normally distributed increments",
    choice2: "B) The increments are independent, and the rate parameter is constant over time",
    choice3: "C) The increments are independent, and the rate parameter is constant over time",
    choice4: "D) It is used only for modeling continuous signals",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "A Poisson process has independent increments, and events occur at a constant average rate over time."
  },
  {
    question: "The concept of a \"conjugate prior\" in Bayesian statistics refers to:",
    choice1: "A) A prior that results in a posterior distribution of the same form",
    choice2: "B) A prior that results in a posterior distribution of the same form",
    choice3: "C) A prior that is independent of the likelihood function",
    choice4: "D) A prior that maximizes the likelihood function",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "A conjugate prior is chosen such that the posterior distribution is in the same family as the prior, simplifying Bayesian inference."
  },
  {
    question: "In optimization, which of the following algorithms is most commonly used for finding the saddle points in deep learning models?",
    choice1: "A) Newton‚Äôs method",
    choice2: "B) Adam optimizer",
    choice3: "C) Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum",
    choice4: "D) Conjugate Gradient Descent",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "SGD with momentum helps escape saddle points and accelerates training by smoothing the optimization path."
  },
  {
    question: "In information theory, the mutual information between two random variables is used to measure:",
    choice1: "A) The total entropy of the system",
    choice2: "B) The difference between the joint and marginal entropies",
    choice3: "C) The amount of information shared between the variables",
    choice4: "D) The conditional probability of one variable given the other",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Mutual information quantifies the amount of information obtained about one variable through observing another."
  },
  {
    question: "The concept of \"regularization\" in machine learning refers to:",
    choice1: "A) Adding a penalty term to the objective function to prevent overfitting",
    choice2: "B) Adding a penalty term to the objective function to prevent overfitting",
    choice3: "C) Increasing the size of the training data to improve model performance",
    choice4: "D) Decreasing the number of features in the model",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 help control model complexity and prevent overfitting."
  },
  {
    question: "In the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the E-step involves:",
    choice1: "A) Maximizing the likelihood function with respect to the model parameters",
    choice2: "B) Computing the expected value of the latent variables given the observed data",
    choice3: "C) Estimating the distribution of the observed data",
    choice4: "D) Updating the model parameters based on the data",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The E-step estimates the missing data (latent variables) based on current parameter values."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is the main limitation of the K-means clustering algorithm?",
    choice1: "A) It cannot handle large datasets",
    choice2: "B) It requires labeled data",
    choice3: "C) It is sensitive to the initial choice of centroids",
    choice4: "D) It cannot handle categorical data",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "K-means may converge to suboptimal solutions depending on the initial centroids chosen."
  },
  {
    question: "The Fokker-Planck equation is used to model:",
    choice1: "A) The distribution of random variables in a deterministic system",
    choice2: "B) The transition probabilities in a Markov chain",
    choice3: "C) The time evolution of the probability density function of a stochastic process",
    choice4: "D) The optimization of a stochastic cost function",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "The Fokker-Planck equation describes how the probability density of a stochastic process evolves over time."
  },
  {
    question: "The No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem in optimization and machine learning states that:",
    choice1: "A) No single algorithm can perform best on all possible tasks",
    choice2: "B) No single algorithm can perform best on all possible tasks",
    choice3: "C) All machine learning algorithms are equally effective",
    choice4: "D) Optimization techniques will always converge to the global minimum",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The NFL theorem asserts that performance averages out over all problems‚Äîno one algorithm wins universally."
