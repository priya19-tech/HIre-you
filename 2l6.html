const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the basic idea behind a decision tree?",
    options: [
      "A) To create a single neural network for predictions",
      "B) To split data into subsets based on feature values",
      "C) To transform data using PCA",
      "D) To cluster data points into groups"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "A decision tree works by splitting data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a disadvantage of decision trees?",
    options: [
      "A) They are hard to interpret",
      "B) They are computationally expensive",
      "C) They are prone to overfitting",
      "D) They can't handle categorical data"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Decision trees tend to overfit training data, especially when they become very deep and complex."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of pruning in decision trees?",
    options: [
      "A) To speed up training time",
      "B) To balance the dataset",
      "C) To reduce overfitting by removing branches",
      "D) To convert the model to a linear one"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Pruning involves removing unnecessary nodes or branches from the tree to improve generalization and reduce overfitting."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following techniques reduces overfitting in decision trees?",
    options: [
      "A) Increasing the tree depth",
      "B) Using ensemble methods like Random Forest",
      "C) Ignoring feature importance",
      "D) Choosing more complex features"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Ensemble methods like Random Forest combine multiple trees and reduce the risk of overfitting by averaging predictions."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of Gini Impurity or Information Gain in decision trees?",
    options: [
      "A) To handle missing values",
      "B) To prune the tree",
      "C) To decide the best feature for splitting",
      "D) To evaluate model performance"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Gini Impurity and Information Gain are used to evaluate how good a feature is at splitting the dataset, helping the tree decide where to branch."
  },
  {
    question: "A deep decision tree that performs well on training data but poorly on new data is likely:",
    options: [
      "A) Underfitting",
      "B) Overfitting",
      "C) Optimized",
      "D) Regularized"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including noise and details that don‚Äôt generalize."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the main idea of a Random Forest?",
    options: [
      "A) A linear stack of trees",
      "B) An ensemble of multiple decision trees using bagging",
      "C) A combination of SVMs and trees",
      "D) A single large tree with no pruning"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Random Forest builds many decision trees using bootstrapped samples and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting."
  },
  {
    question: "Which parameter in decision trees limits the depth of the tree?",
    options: [
      "A) min_samples_split",
      "B) max_depth",
      "C) criterion",
      "D) bootstrap"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The max_depth parameter controls how deep the tree can grow, helping prevent overfitting by limiting complexity."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the benefit of feature importance scores in decision trees?",
    options: [
      "A) They help interpret which features are most useful for predictions",
      "B) They increase accuracy",
      "C) They reduce training time",
      "D) They remove redundant data"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Decision trees naturally provide feature importance scores, which indicate which features are most influential in the model."
  },
  {
    question: "Which situation is most likely to cause underfitting in decision trees?",
    options: [
      "A) Large tree depth",
      "B) Pruning too little",
      "C) Setting a very low max depth",
      "D) Using all features"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "If the max depth is too shallow, the tree won‚Äôt capture enough patterns in the data, leading to underfitting."
