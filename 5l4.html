const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is one of the primary uses of AI in disease prediction?",
    choice1: "A) Data encryption",
    choice2: "B) Predicting equipment failure",
    choice3: "C) Early identification of chronic diseases",
    choice4: "D) Scheduling appointments",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "AI can analyze patient history, genetics, and lifestyle factors to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases like diabetes or heart conditions before symptoms appear."
  },
  {
    question: "Which type of AI is most commonly used in medical image analysis?",
    choice1: "A) Reinforcement Learning",
    choice2: "B) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)",
    choice3: "C) Decision Trees",
    choice4: "D) Support Vector Machines",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "CNNs are especially effective at identifying patterns in image data, making them ideal for analyzing X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans in medical diagnostics."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is NOT a typical AI application in patient monitoring?",
    choice1: "A) Monitoring vital signs in real-time",
    choice2: "B) Generating synthetic patient records",
    choice3: "C) Detecting anomalies in heart rhythms",
    choice4: "D) Predicting patient deterioration",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Generating synthetic patient records is a data generation task and not part of real-time patient monitoring, which focuses on ongoing health data analysis."
  },
  {
    question: "What is HIPAA mainly concerned with?",
    choice1: "A) AI algorithm performance",
    choice2: "B) Cloud infrastructure speed",
    choice3: "C) Protecting patient health information",
    choice4: "D) Reducing healthcare costs",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a U.S. regulation focused on maintaining the privacy and security of patient health information."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a major challenge of applying AI in healthcare?",
    choice1: "A) Lack of available computing hardware",
    choice2: "B) Too much structured data",
    choice3: "C) Data privacy and regulation compliance",
    choice4: "D) Limited number of diseases",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Healthcare data is sensitive, and any AI system handling it must comply with strict privacy regulations like HIPAA, making implementation more complex."
  },

    question: "Which AI technology helps in interpreting medical images?",
    choice1: "A) Generative Adversarial Networks",
    choice2: "B) Convolutional Neural Networks",
    choice3: "C) K-means Clustering",
    choice4: "D) Naive Bayes Classifier",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "CNNs are specifically designed for tasks involving images and spatial data, making them the go-to for tasks like tumor detection in radiology."
  },
  {
    question: "How can AI assist in ICU patient monitoring?",
    choice1: "A) By replacing nurses",
    choice2: "B) Predicting the need for ventilators",
    choice3: "C) Automating legal compliance",
    choice4: "D) Encrypting patient emails",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "AI models analyze patterns in vital signs and other data to predict clinical interventions like the need for ventilator support or detecting early deterioration."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of data is essential for AI to predict health risks?",
    choice1: "A) Social media posts",
    choice2: "B) Weather forecasts",
    choice3: "C) Electronic Health Records (EHRs)",
    choice4: "D) CAPTCHA results",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "EHRs contain comprehensive patient data such as medical history, lab results, and treatments‚Äîessential for training models to predict health outcomes."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following best describes a real AI use case in radiology?",
    choice1: "A) Predicting hospital revenue",
    choice2: "B) Identifying tumors in MRI scans",
    choice3: "C) Managing hospital cafeteria inventory",
    choice4: "D) Tracking patient parking lot usage",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "AI systems, especially CNNs, can detect anomalies such as tumors in radiological images with high accuracy, aiding radiologists in diagnosis."
  },
  {
    question: "What‚Äôs a potential benefit of AI-driven predictive analytics in healthcare?",
    choice1: "A) Increases paperwork",
    choice2: "B) Reduces data quality",
    choice3: "C) Improves preventive care by identifying high-risk patients",
    choice4: "D) Eliminates the need for doctors",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Predictive analytics helps identify patients at risk for diseases early, allowing for timely preventive interventions and personalized care."
