const questions = [
  {
    question: "Which of the following is the primary objective of using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?",
    choice1: "A) To maximize the variance of the features",
    choice2: "B) To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible",
    choice3: "C) To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible",
    choice4: "D) To normalize the dataset",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "PCA reduces the dimensionality of a dataset by transforming it into a new set of variables that retain the most variance."
  },
  {
    question: "The Cholesky decomposition is particularly useful for:",
    choice1: "A) Solving linear systems with sparse matrices",
    choice2: "B) Finding the eigenvalues of a matrix",
    choice3: "C) Solving linear systems for positive-definite matrices",
    choice4: "D) Performing singular value decomposition",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Cholesky decomposition is an efficient method for solving systems with symmetric, positive-definite matrices."
  },
  {
    question: "The Fourier Transform is used to:",
    choice1: "A) Transform a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain",
    choice2: "B) Compute the eigenvectors of a matrix",
    choice3: "C) Compute the inverse of a matrix",
    choice4: "D) Solve linear equations",
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Fourier Transform is widely used to analyze the frequency components of a signal."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of dropout in neural networks?",
    choice1: "A) To speed up the training process",
    choice2: "B) To prevent overfitting by randomly setting some weights to zero during training",
    choice3: "C) To increase the accuracy of the model on the validation set",
    choice4: "D) To optimize the loss function using gradient descent",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units (along with their connections) during training."
  },
  {
    question: "The Dirichlet distribution is often used in machine learning to model:",
    choice1: "A) Multinomial distributions in classification problems",
    choice2: "B) The relationship between different categories in a dataset",
    choice3: "C) The distribution of probabilities over multiple categories in a mixture model",
    choice4: "D) Continuous data distributions in regression problems",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Dirichlet distribution models probabilities over a set of categories, useful in topic modeling and Bayesian methods."
  },
  {
    question: "In optimization, the concept of a saddle point refers to:",
    choice1: "A) A point where the gradient is zero and the function is concave upwards",
    choice2: "B) A point where the gradient is zero, but the function has both upward and downward curvature",
    choice3: "C) A point where the function has a global minimum",
    choice4: "D) A point where the function is convex in all directions",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "A saddle point is where the function curves up in one direction and down in another, despite having zero gradient."
  },
  {
    question: "The multivariate Gaussian distribution is used to model:",
    choice1: "A) A collection of uncorrelated random variables",
    choice2: "B) A set of independent events",
    choice3: "C) A set of correlated random variables with a joint normal distribution",
    choice4: "D) The distribution of a single random variable",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "The multivariate Gaussian captures the joint behavior of multiple correlated continuous variables."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following methods is used for dimensionality reduction in a linear setting?",
    choice1: "A) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)",
    choice2: "B) Autoencoders",
    choice3: "C) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
    choice4: "D) Independent Component Analysis (ICA)",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "PCA is a linear technique for dimensionality reduction that projects data along directions of maximum variance."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is an essential characteristic of an orthogonal matrix?",
    choice1: "A) The rows and columns are not linearly independent",
    choice2: "B) The transpose of the matrix is equal to its inverse",
    choice3: "C) The determinant of the matrix is zero",
    choice4: "D) It cannot be diagonalized",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "For orthogonal matrices, A·µÄ = A‚Åª¬π, which means rows and columns are orthonormal."
  },
  {
    question: "The softmax function is often used in machine learning for:",
    choice1: "A) Converting a probability distribution into binary outcomes",
    choice2: "B) Outputting probabilities that sum to 1 for multi-class classification",
    choice3: "C) Converting continuous values into discrete binary classes",
    choice4: "D) Normalizing weights during training",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Softmax transforms outputs into probabilities that sum to 1, making it ideal for multi-class classification tasks."
