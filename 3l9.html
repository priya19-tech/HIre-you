const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the core idea behind transfer learning?",
    options: [
      "A) Training a model from scratch",
      "B) Using unlabeled data only",
      "C) Using knowledge from a pre-trained model for a new but related task",
      "D) Using unsupervised learning only"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Transfer learning involves leveraging a model trained on one task and adapting it for a different (often related) task to save time and data."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a key benefit of transfer learning?",
    options: [
      "A) Increased overfitting",
      "B) Needs larger dataset",
      "C) Faster training and better performance on smaller datasets",
      "D) Requires complex hardware"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Since pretrained models have already learned useful features, they can be fine-tuned quickly on smaller datasets."
  },
  {
    question: "What does \"fine-tuning\" refer to in transfer learning?",
    options: [
      "A) Training only the output layer",
      "B) Updating some or all layers of a pretrained model on a new task",
      "C) Compressing the model",
      "D) Reducing dropout"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Fine-tuning adjusts the weights of a pretrained model to better fit a new dataset/task."
  },
  {
    question: "In which layer(s) are weights typically frozen during transfer learning?",
    options: [
      "A) Early layers",
      "B) Output layer",
      "C) All layers",
      "D) Final layers only"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Early layers capture general features (edges, textures), so they‚Äôre often frozen, while deeper layers are fine-tuned."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of tasks is ResNet commonly pretrained for?",
    options: [
      "A) Text summarization",
      "B) Speech recognition",
      "C) Image classification",
      "D) Sentiment analysis"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "ResNet is a convolutional neural network architecture trained primarily on image datasets like ImageNet."
  },
  {
    question: "Which pretrained model is best suited for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or text classification?",
    options: [
      "A) ResNet",
      "B) VGG16",
      "C) BERT",
      "D) LeNet"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is designed specifically for natural language understanding tasks."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a common strategy when using BERT for a new NLP task?",
    options: [
      "A) Remove all layers",
      "B) Add a task-specific output layer and fine-tune",
      "C) Freeze all layers",
      "D) Convert it to a CNN"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "For transfer learning with BERT, a small output head is added (e.g., classifier), and the entire model or last few layers are fine-tuned."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are pretrained models like ResNet or BERT effective for transfer learning?",
    options: [
      "A) They are always the best models",
      "B) They learn general-purpose features useful for many tasks",
      "C) They are smaller",
      "D) They require no data to train"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Pretrained models are trained on large datasets and learn representations that transfer well to related tasks."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the downside of using very large pretrained models like BERT or GPT in production?",
    options: [
      "A) High computational and memory cost",
      "B) Low accuracy",
      "C) Lack of training data",
      "D) Limited to image tasks"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "These models are often very large, making them resource-intensive to deploy and slow to infer."
  },
  {
    question: "Which approach best describes \"feature extraction\" in transfer learning?",
    options: [
      "A) Training all model layers",
      "B) Using random weights",
      "C) Using pretrained model to extract features without updating weights",
      "D) Performing hyperparameter tuning"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "In feature extraction, the pretrained model is used as a fixed feature extractor ‚Äî the model‚Äôs layers are frozen and only the output layer is trained."
