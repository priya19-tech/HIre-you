  <h1 class="main-title">💬 Prompt Engineer - Syllabus Overview</h1>
  <h3>Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and refining the input given to a language model (such as GPT) to ensure it generates useful, accurate, and contextually relevant outputs. This involves crafting specific instructions, questions, or tasks that guide the model in producing the best possible response. Prompt engineering is key to getting the most out of AI models and is widely used in various applications such as chatbots, content generation, and machine learning tasks.</h3>

      <h2 class="section-title">1. 🧾Clear and Specific Instructions</h2>
      <p>A well-designed prompt should clearly and specifically state what the user wants the AI to do. Vague or unclear instructions can lead to irrelevant or inaccurate responses. For example, instead of asking "Tell me about the weather," a more specific prompt would be "What is the current weather in New York City?" This removes ambiguity and increases the likelihood of getting a useful response.

      <h2 class="section-title">2.🔥Temperature Control</h2>
      <p>Temperature is a parameter that controls the creativity and randomness of the model’s output. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) will make the model’s responses more focused and deterministic, ideal for factual or structured content. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.9) makes the model more creative, producing more diverse and potentially unexpected responses.

      <h2 class="section-title">3. 📏 Token Limits and Efficiency</h2>
      <p>Tokens are the smallest units of text that the model processes, including words and punctuation. Every model has a limit on the number of tokens it can handle in a single input-output pair. For example, if a model has a 2048-token limit, the combined total of your prompt and the model's response cannot exceed that number.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">4.🎯Few-Shot vs Zero-Shot Learning</h2>
      <p>Zero-shot learning is when the model is asked to perform a task without any prior examples, relying solely on its pre-existing knowledge. Few-shot learning involves providing the model with a few examples to guide it in understanding how to respond to the task. Few-shot learning typically yields better results when you want more context-specific outputs.

      <h2 class="section-title">5.🔗 Contextual Understanding and Prompt Chaining</h2>
      <p>Contextual understanding refers to the model’s ability to maintain the context of a conversation or task across multiple interactions. Prompt chaining is the technique of connecting multiple prompts to handle complex, multi-step tasks. For example, one prompt might gather data, the next might process it, and the third might generate an analysis based on the processed data.</p>
