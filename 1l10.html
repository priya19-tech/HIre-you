    choice3: "C) To minimize the cost function in logistic regression",
    choice4: "D) To perform linear regression analysis",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Newton-Raphson is an iterative root-finding algorithm that uses the function's derivative and second derivative to converge to a solution quickly."
  },
  {
    question: "In the context of machine learning, what is the purpose of the Jacobian matrix?",
    choice1: "A) To compute the gradient of a scalar function with respect to the input",

    choice3: "C) To compute the loss function",
    choice4: "D) To update the model parameters in gradient descent",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The Jacobian matrix is used for functions that map vectors to vectors and is important in sensitivity analysis and backpropagation."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary objective of the variational inference method in Bayesian statistics?",
    choice1: "A) To find the exact posterior distribution of the model parameters",
    choice2: "B) To approximate the likelihood function of the model",
    choice3: "C) To approximate the posterior distribution using simpler distributions",
    choice4: "D) To minimize the loss function in a probabilistic model",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Variational inference approximates complex posterior distributions by optimizing over a family of simpler distributions."
  },
  {
    question: "In gradient-based optimization, what does the learning rate control?",
    choice1: "A) The size of the dataset used in each iteration",
    choice2: "B) The step size taken in the direction of the gradient",
    choice3: "C) The number of hidden layers in a neural network",
    choice4: "D) The output range of the activation function",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The learning rate determines how large a step is taken toward the minimum of the loss function during each iteration of optimization."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is true about a Markov Decision Process (MDP)?",
    choice1: "A) The state of the system is determined solely by its past states",
    choice2: "B) The future state depends only on the current state and action",
    choice3: "C) The rewards in the MDP are independent of the actions taken",
    choice4: "D) It does not involve any transition probabilities",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "MDPs satisfy the Markov property: future states depend only on the present state and action, not past states."
  },

    question: "The Wiener process is a type of:",
    choice1: "A) Stochastic differential equation",
    choice2: "B) Discrete-time random walk",
    choice3: "C) Continuous-time stochastic process",

    choice3: "C) The probability of the agent transitioning between states",
    choice4: "D) The immediate reward the agent receives from a specific action",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The value function measures how good it is to be in a state, considering expected future rewards."
  },
  {
    question: "In a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), the responsibility of a cluster is calculated using:",
    choice1: "A) Maximum likelihood estimation",
