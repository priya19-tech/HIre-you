const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the key idea behind Decision Trees in machine learning?",
    choice1: "A) Assign weights to features",
    choice2: "B) Combine weak models",
    choice3: "C) Split data into smaller subsets based on feature values",
    choice4: "D) Randomly assign classes",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "A Decision Tree recursively splits the dataset into smaller subsets based on conditions on feature values, forming a tree-like structure."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary issue with deep decision trees?",
    choice1: "A) They cannot handle categorical data",
    choice2: "B) They are computationally inefficient",
    choice3: "C) They tend to overfit the training data",
    choice4: "D) They ignore feature importance",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Deep decision trees often learn noise from training data and hence overfit, meaning they don‚Äôt generalize well to unseen data."
  },
  {
    question: "Which technique is commonly used to reduce overfitting in decision trees?",
    choice1: "A) Feature scaling",
    choice2: "B) Bagging",
    choice3: "C) Pruning",
    choice4: "D) One-hot encoding",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Pruning is the process of removing branches that have little predictive power, helping simplify the model and reduce overfitting."
  },
  {
    question: "In a decision tree, what does a ‚Äúleaf node‚Äù represent?",
    choice1: "A) A split based on a feature",
    choice2: "B) A feature value",
    choice3: "C) A final prediction or class",
    choice4: "D) The root of the tree",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Leaf nodes are the terminal nodes of a decision tree that represent the output/class label for a set of input conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "What is 'Gini Index' used for in decision trees?",
    choice1: "A) Measuring the distance between two points",
    choice2: "B) Calculating correlation",
    choice3: "C) Measuring the purity of a node",
    choice4: "D) Calculating probability distributions",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "The Gini Index measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly labeled, indicating node impurity in classification trees."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Random Forest reduce overfitting compared to a single decision tree?",
    choice1: "A) By pruning each tree deeply",
    choice2: "B) By building multiple trees and aggregating their results",
    choice3: "C) By using PCA",
    choice4: "D) By combining logistic regression",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Random Forest builds multiple decision trees using random subsets of data/features and averages their predictions, improving generalization and reducing overfitting."
  },
  {
    question: "What does Random Forest use to ensure diversity among its trees?",
    choice1: "A) Dropout",
    choice2: "B) Different activation functions",
    choice3: "C) Random selection of features and samples (bagging)",
    choice4: "D) Same data and all features",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Random Forest applies bagging (bootstrap aggregating) where random subsets of training data and random features are used for each tree."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'feature importance' in tree-based models tell us?",
    choice1: "A) Which features cause overfitting",
    choice2: "B) Which features take the longest to process",
    choice3: "C) Which features contribute most to reducing impurity",
    choice4: "D) Which features are categorical",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Feature importance measures how much a feature helps in reducing impurity (Gini, Entropy) across all nodes it's used in the tree."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of ensemble method is Random Forest?",
    choice1: "A) Boosting",
    choice2: "B) Stacking",
    choice3: "C) Bagging",
    choice4: "D) Blending",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Random Forest is based on bagging ‚Äì building multiple independent models on bootstrapped datasets and averaging their outputs."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a major advantage of Random Forest over a single decision tree?",
    choice1: "A) Faster training",
    choice2: "B) Less memory usage",
    choice3: "C) Lower variance and better generalization",
    choice4: "D) Easier to interpret",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Random Forests reduce variance by averaging multiple trees, making them less likely to overfit than a single tree."
