const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is an adversarial attack in machine learning?",
    choice1: "A) A denial-of-service (DoS) on training servers",
    choice2: "B) Injecting malware into the training script",
    choice3: "C) Slight input modifications to fool the model",
    choice4: "D) Using high-quality data to improve model accuracy",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Adversarial attacks involve making small, intentional perturbations to input data that lead to incorrect model predictions, often undetected by humans."
  },
  {
    question: "Which technique helps defend against adversarial attacks?",
    choice1: "A) Cross-validation",
    choice2: "B) Adversarial training",
    choice3: "C) PCA (Principal Component Analysis)",
    choice4: "D) Bagging",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Adversarial training involves training the model on adversarial examples to improve robustness against such inputs."
  },
  {
    question: "What is model robustness?",
    choice1: "A) The ability to detect adversaries",
    choice2: "B) The model‚Äôs performance on a single dataset",
    choice3: "C) The model‚Äôs resilience to input variations or attacks",
    choice4: "D) How fast the model trains",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Robustness measures how well a model maintains performance when faced with noise, attacks, or input distribution shifts."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a data poisoning attack?",
    choice1: "A) Injecting irrelevant data during preprocessing",
    choice2: "B) Encrypting the training dataset",
    choice3: "C) Inserting malicious data points to corrupt model behavior",
    choice4: "D) Reducing training data quality",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Data poisoning refers to injecting malicious samples into the training data to bias or corrupt the model‚Äôs predictions."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of these is a secure model deployment practice?",
    choice1: "A) Exposing model internals through APIs",
    choice2: "B) Limiting access to inference endpoints",
    choice3: "C) Allowing write access to training data via API",
    choice4: "D) Using public S3 buckets for sensitive models",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Limiting access to APIs/endpoints reduces the risk of misuse or exploitation of the deployed model."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a black-box attack strategy?",
    choice1: "A) Accessing model weights directly",
    choice2: "B) Analyzing gradients of the model",
    choice3: "C) Querying the model repeatedly to guess its behavior",
    choice4: "D) Reading training data",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Black-box attacks don‚Äôt require internal access; they rely on repeated queries and responses to infer the model‚Äôs logic."
  },
  {
    question: "What is gradient masking, and why can it be problematic?",
    choice1: "A) A regularization method to reduce overfitting",
    choice2: "B) Obscuring gradients to defend against attacks, but may give a false sense of security",
    choice3: "C) A training trick to speed up computation",
    choice4: "D) Masking gradients to improve accuracy",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Gradient masking hides gradients to confuse attackers but often results in poor generalization and does not truly protect against stronger adversaries."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of model is particularly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations?",
    choice1: "A) Rule-based models",
    choice2: "B) Linear regression models",
    choice3: "C) Deep neural networks",
    choice4: "D) Random forests",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Deep neural networks, due to their high dimensionality and complex decision boundaries, are particularly susceptible to adversarial inputs."
  },
  {
    question: "Which technique improves both robustness and generalization?",
    choice1: "A) Overfitting",
    choice2: "B) Adversarial training",
    choice3: "C) Feature selection",
    choice4: "D) Increasing model depth",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Adversarial training introduces perturbed samples during training, which helps the model generalize better and withstand attacks."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of input sanitization in AI model security?",
    choice1: "A) To increase inference time",
    choice2: "B) To reduce training loss",
    choice3: "C) To validate and clean input data to avoid malicious inputs",
    choice4: "D) To normalize labels",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Input sanitization ensures that inputs are checked and cleaned before being processed by the model, preventing harmful or manipulated data from affecting the system."
