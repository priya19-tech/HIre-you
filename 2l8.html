const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the main idea behind the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm?",
    options: [
      "A) Build a decision tree from data",
      "B) Use probabilistic inference",
      "C) Predict the output based on the majority label of the nearest data points",
      "D) Train a linear model"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "KNN predicts the class of a sample based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the training set."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of the parameter k in KNN?",
    options: [
      "A) Defines the number of trees",
      "B) Determines how many neighbors to consider when making a prediction",
      "C) Determines the depth of the decision boundary",
      "D) Sets the learning rate"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The k in KNN specifies how many closest training samples should be considered to make predictions."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the value of k is too low (e.g., 1)?",
    options: [
      "A) The model becomes too general",
      "B) The model may overfit the noise in the data",
      "C) Accuracy will always increase",
      "D) All data points will be classified to the same class"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "A small k makes the model sensitive to noise and outliers, leading to overfitting."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the value of k is too high?",
    options: [
      "A) Overfitting increases",
      "B) Prediction speed increases",
      "C) The model may underfit and become too simple",
      "D) Accuracy always improves"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "A large k smooths out the decision boundary too much and can lead to underfitting."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a common distance metric used in KNN?",
    options: [
      "A) Gini Index",
      "B) Euclidean Distance",
      "C) Entropy",
      "D) Cosine Similarity Tree"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Euclidean distance is one of the most commonly used metrics in KNN to measure similarity between points."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following situations might cause KNN to perform poorly?",
    options: [
      "A) Very high-dimensional feature space",
      "B) Binary classification problems",
      "C) When k is an odd number",
      "D) When data is normalized"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "In high-dimensional spaces, distance measures lose meaning due to the 'curse of dimensionality,' which can harm KNN's performance."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of learning algorithm is KNN?",
    options: [
      "A) Lazy learning algorithm",
      "B) Eager learning algorithm",
      "C) Online learning algorithm",
      "D) Reinforcement learning algorithm"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "KNN is a lazy learning algorithm because it doesn't learn from the training data immediately‚Äîit stores it and computes predictions during inference."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following steps is important before applying KNN?",
    options: [
      "A) One-hot encoding",
      "B) Feature scaling or normalization",
      "C) Dimensionality reduction using LSTM",
      "D) Regularization"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Since KNN relies on distance calculations, features should be scaled (e.g., using normalization or standardization) to avoid bias."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a weighted KNN?",
    options: [
      "A) A KNN that uses weights to update model parameters",
      "B) A version where closer neighbors have more influence than farther ones",
      "C) A KNN with regularization",
      "D) A KNN that uses unsupervised learning"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "In weighted KNN, each neighbor's vote is weighted by its distance‚Äîcloser neighbors contribute more to the prediction."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a disadvantage of KNN?",
    options: [
      "A) It can‚Äôt be used for classification",
      "B) It is computationally expensive at prediction time",
      "C) It doesn‚Äôt require distance metrics",
      "D) It cannot handle continuous data"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "KNN stores all training data and computes distances during prediction, making it slow for large datasets."
