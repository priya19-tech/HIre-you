    choice1: "A) To minimize the cost function directly",
    choice2: "B) To handle constrained optimization problems by incorporating constraints into the objective function",
    choice3: "C) To handle constrained optimization problems by incorporating constraints into the objective function",
    choice4: "D) To calculate the gradient of the objective function",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "The Lagrangian allows for solving constrained problems by combining the objective function with constraints."

    question: "Which of the following is true about the multivariate normal distribution?",
    choice1: "A) All variables are independent and identically distributed",
    choice2: "B) The covariance matrix is always diagonal",
    choice3: "C) The covariance matrix contains correlations between the variables",
    choice4: "D) The distribution only applies to discrete random variables",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "In a multivariate normal distribution, the covariance matrix captures the relationships between variables."

    choice1: "A) The probability distribution over the possible outcomes",
    choice2: "B) The probability of moving from one state to another in the chain",
    choice3: "C) The expected number of transitions between states",
    choice4: "D) The total number of states in the chain",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The transition matrix indicates the probability of transitioning between each pair of states."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is the definition of a convex function?",
    choice1: "A) A function where the second derivative is always positive",
    choice2: "B) A function where the line segment between any two points on the graph lies above the graph",
    choice3: "C) A function with no local minima",
    choice4: "D) A function that only has a global minimum",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "A convex function has the property that a line between any two points on its graph lies above the graph."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the term \"gradient explosion\" refer to in the context of training deep neural networks?",
    choice1: "A) The gradients become too small to make any changes during training",
    choice2: "B) The gradients become excessively large, causing unstable training",
    choice3: "C) The loss function stops decreasing",
    choice4: "D) The model converges too quickly",
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Gradient explosion occurs when gradients grow too large, destabilizing learning."
  },
  {
    question: "The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is primarily used for:",
    choice1: "A) Minimizing the cost function in linear regression",
    choice2: "B) Finding the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in probabilistic models with missing data",
    choice3: "C) Finding the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in probabilistic models with missing data",
    choice4: "D) Determining the optimal weight update in deep learning",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "EM is commonly used for estimating parameters when data is incomplete or has latent variables."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a characteristic of a Laplace distribution?",
    choice1: "A) It has a heavy-tailed distribution compared to the normal distribution",
    choice2: "B) Its mean is always zero",
    choice3: "C) It has a sharp peak at the mean and heavier tails than the normal distribution",
    choice4: "D) Its variance is always equal to 1",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "The Laplace distribution has a peak at the mean and heavier tails, making it useful for capturing outliers."
  },
  {
    question: "In machine learning, what is the purpose of the bias term in a linear model?",
    choice1: "A) To shift the input values before applying the linear transformation",
    choice2: "B) To ensure that the model‚Äôs output is always positive",
    choice3: "C) To allow the model to fit the data even when the origin is not part of the solution",
    choice4: "D) To minimize the regularization term in the cost function",
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "The bias term helps shift the decision boundary to better fit the data."
